# Laura RV's emotional sensory gating experiments

Task: listen to the sounds. If the sounds are beeps, do nothing. If the sounds are clicks, press the space bar.

Trial sequence: { | 2000ms | sound | 500ms | sound | random(min=5000ms, max=8000ms) during which permit subject to press spacebar if the sounds were clicks | }

Experiment structure: 2 * (mood induction > block of trials). The mood induction is done as an offline pen and paper exercise. There are 2 levels of mood induction, anger; neutral. The order of (A) angry > trials; (B) neutral > trials is randomised between subjects so that some get A > B and others get B > A. A block is 80 trials. There is a rest after 40 trials. In one block there should be 76 trials where the sounds are both beeps, and 4 trials where the sounds are both clicks. The other block should have 75 trials where the sounds are both beeps and 5 trials where the sounds are both clicks.
