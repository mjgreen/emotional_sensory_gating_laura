- [x] Block Number in output
- [x] Participant Number in output
- [x] "Take a break" stimulus to replace fixation cross during breaks
- [x] GUI for participant number, no input()
- [ ] Black Box test trigger-to-sound-onset latency and jitter 
- [ ] histograms for latency and jitter (matplotlib / pylab)
