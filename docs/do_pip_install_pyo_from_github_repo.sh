#If you want to be able to use all of pyoâ€™s gui widgets, you will need wxPython-phoenix.

#    Install requirements outlined in the README.rst at https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/README.rst

sudo pip3 install -U wxPython

In the ./scripts folder, there is some alternate scripts to simplify the compilation process a little bit. These scripts will compile pyo for the version of python pointed to by the command python.

To compile both 32-bit and 64-bit resolutions on linux with jack support:

sudo sh scripts/compile_linux_withJack.sh
